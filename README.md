# generic_office_tools
To automate some office tasks while working in small cross-functional teams during 2022-2024, mostly dealing with csvs (for tabular datasets and also QGIS) and final deliverables (ie: custom made scripts to support semi-automated workflow to generate, modify, or process a large number of PDF reports).  

Still being updated. (Last updated March 2025.)
